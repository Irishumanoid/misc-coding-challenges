It presents to the pilot an out-the-window view of his target in correct 6 degrees of freedom motion. The scene is obtained by a television camera pick-up viewing a small-scale gimbaled model of the target. \"For docking studies, the docking target picture was projected onto the surface of a 20-foot-diameter sphere and the pilot could, effectively, maneuver into contract. this facility was used in a comparison study with the Rendezvous Docking Simulator - one of the few comparison experiments in which conditions were carefully controlled and a reasonable sample of pilots used. All pilots preferred the more realistic RDS visual scene. The pilots generally liked the RDS angular motion cues although some objected to the false gravity cues that these motions introduced. Training time was shorter on the RDS, but final performance on both simulators was essentially equal. \" \"For station-keeping studies, since close approach is not required, the target was presented to the pilot through a virtual-image system which projects his view to infinity, providing a more realistic effect. In addition to the target, the system also projects a star and horizon background. \""}], "links": [{"href": "https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/LRC-1963-B701_P-08421/LRC-1963-B701_P-08421~thumb.jpg", "rel": "preview", "render": "image"}]}, {"href": "https://images-assets.nasa.gov/image/KSC-20220902-PH-SBS02_0107/collection.json", "data": [{"center": "KSC", "date_created": "2022-09-02T00:00:00Z", "description": "From left to right, NASA astronaut candidates Anil Menon, Deniz Burnham, and Marcos Berrios pose for a photograph in front of NASA\u2019s Artemis I Space Launch System and Orion spacecraft atop the mobile launcher on the pad at Launch Complex 39B at the agency\u2019s Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Sept. 2, 2022.
